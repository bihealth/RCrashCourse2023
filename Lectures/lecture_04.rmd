# Searching, sorting and selecting

## sort and order

`sort` directly sorts a vector:

```{r}
v <- sample(1:10)/10 # randomize numbers 1-10
sort(v)

## decreasing 
sort(v, decreasing=TRUE)

## same as
rev(sort(v))
```

However, `order` is more useful. It returns the *position*
of a value in a sorted vector.

```{r}
order(v)
order(v, decreasing=TRUE)
```

## sort and order cont.

`sort` and `order` can be applied to character vectors as well:

```{r}
l <- sample(letters, 10)
sort(l)
order(l, decreasing=TRUE)
```

Note that sorting values turned to a character vector will not give
expected results:

```{r}
v <- sample(1:200, 15)
sort(as.character(v))
```

## Sorting data frames

To sort a data frame according to one of its columns, we use `order` and
then select rows of a data frame based on that order. That is the "classic"
way of sorting.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(id=paste0("ID", 1:10), val=rnorm(10))
ord <- order(df$val)
df[ ord, ]
df[ order(df$val, decreasing=TRUE), ]
df[ order(abs(df$val), decreasing=TRUE), ]
```

For numeric values, instead of `decreasing=TRUE`, you can just order by
`-abs(df$val)`.

## Sorting data frames with tidyverse

Sorting with tidyverse is easier. 

```{r}
arrange(df, val)

## reverse sort
arrange(df, desc(val)) 

## largest absolute values first
arrange(df, desc(abs(val))) 
```

## Sorting data frames with tidyverse


```{r}
arrange(df, val)
```

Note the lack of quotes around `val`! This is a feature in tidyverse which
has two effects:

 * it is easier to type (you save the typing of `df$`!
   imagine how much time you have now)
 * it is confusing for beginners ("why are there no quotes?", "when should
   I use quotes and when not?", "how does it know that it is `df$val` and
   not some other `val`?") 
 * makes programming confusing (what if
   "val" holds the *name* of the column that you would like to sort by? -
   use `.data[[val]]`; Or is some other vector by which you wish to sort?)


## Example

```{r, eval=TRUE}
## read the transcriptomic results data set
res <- read.csv("Datasets/transcriptomics_results.csv")

## only interesting columns
res <- res[ , c(3, 5, 8:9) ]
colnames(res) <- c("Gene", "Description", "LFC", "p.value")
```


## Example cont.

We can use sort, factor and level to find out more about our data set:

```{r}
desc.sum <- summary(factor(res$Description))
head(sort(desc.sum, decreasing=TRUE))
```

biomarkers of reactogenicity of licensed antiviral vaccines: randomized
controlled clinical trials conducted by the BIOVACSAFE consortium."

## Example cont.

```{r}
## order by decreasing absolute logFC
ord <- order(abs(res$LFC), decreasing=TRUE)
res <- res[ord, ]
plot(res$LFC[1:250], type="b")

## then, order by p-value
ord <- order(res$p.value)
res <- res[ord, ]
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:250]), type="b")
plot(res$p.value[1:250], type="b", log="y")
```

## Plot with LOESS smoothing

```{r, eval=FALSE}
lo <- loess.smooth(1:500, abs(res$LFC[1:500]))
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:500]), col="grey", type="b", bty="n",
  ylab="Log2 fold change")
lines(lo$x, lo$y)
```

## Plot with LOESS smoothing

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE,fig.width=7,fig.height=5}
## with echo=FALSE, this code does not show on presentation
## otherwise the figure does not fit!
ord <- order(abs(res$LFC), decreasing=TRUE)
res <- res[ord, ]
ord <- order(res$p.value)
res <- res[ord, ]

lo <- loess.smooth(1:500, abs(res$LFC[1:500]))
plot(abs(res$LFC[1:500]), col="grey", type="b", bty="n",
  ylab="Log2 fold change")
lines(lo$x, lo$y)

```

## Selecting / filtering of data frames

There are two ways, both simple. In both of them, you need to have a
logical vector that indicates which rows to keep and which to remove.

```{r eval=FALSE}
keep <- res$p.value < 0.05
res[ keep, ]

## or

filter(res, p.value < 0.05)
## note that we don't have to type "res$p.value", 
## see comment about tidyverse above
```

## Excercise 4.1

 * Load the example transcriptomic data (`transcriptomics_results.csv`)
 * Try sorting of the data frame; by gene name, by identifier, by log fold
   change, by absolute log fold change (you can use any method)
 * Create a data frame which contains only genes which have significant
   differences at p < 0.05 and abs(log2FC) > 1.5.
 * How many genes are significantly down-regulated?
 * Order the new data frame by Gene name (A-Z)

# Searching and subsetting

## Searching through data frames

With `%in%`, it is easy to select keywords matching a set.

```{r}
interferon <- c("TAP1","IFIH1","IRF7","PARP9","STAT1","PLSCR1",
                "IFITM1","HERC5","DDX60","USP18","RSAD2","IFIT1")
sel <- res$Gene %in% interferon
res[ sel, ] ## or: filter(res, Gene %in% interferon)
```

## `match()`

We can also use match, which for each element of one vector returns the
position of that element in the second vector:

```{r}
matches <- match(interferon, res$Gene)
res[matches, ]
```

Note however that `match()` looks for the *first* occurence of a match,
whereas `%in%` will return all matches.


## Searching for patterns

What if we don't know the exact name, or if we want to match a more general
pattern? 

For this, we can use `grepl()` (which returns a logical vector) or `grep()`
(which is the same as `which(grepl())`).


```{r}
int <- grep("Interferon", res$Description)
length(int) # no matches

int <- grep("Interferon", res$Description, ignore.case=TRUE)
head(int)
head(res[int, ])
```

## More regular expressions

```{r}
## search for GBP1, GBP2, GBP3, 
## but not GBP12 or pseudo-GBP1
sel <- grep("^GBP[123]$", res$Gene)
res[ sel, ]

## search for either cytokine or chemokine
sel <- grep("(cytokine|chemokine)", res$Description, ignore.case=TRUE)
length(sel)
head(res[ sel, ])
```

## More regular expressions (cont.)

We can use the parentheses for substitution as well. Please don't mind that
weird `\\1`, just learn it.

Remember â€“ `.*` means any character (`.`) any number of times (`*`).
`[0-9]*` means any digit (`[0-9]`) any number of times (`*`).

```{r}
## say we only want the middle part
a <- c("ID-1-2020", "ID-3-2019", "ABC-4-2018")

## extract the middle part
gsub(".*-(.*)-.*", "\\1", a)
```

## Combining searches

We can use the logical operators (`&` and `|`) to combine searches. Thus,
we use `grepl()` rather than `grep()`.

```{r}
sel <- res$Gene %in% interferon
significant <- abs(res$LFC) > 1 & res$p.value < 0.05
sel <- sel & significant

res[sel, ] ## or: filter(res, sel)
```


## Excercise 4.2

 * Search for ribosomal genes. How many did you find?
 * Create a data frame which contains only genes that are not "Other" or
   "Unknown".
 * Find all significantly upregulated cytokines.
 * How many interleukine genes are significantly down-regulated?

# Matching data sets

## Finding common IDs

We can use `intersect()` for that.

```{r}
set1 <- letters[1:5]
set2 <- letters[3:7]
intersect(set1, set2)
```


## Finding common IDs cont.


```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(ID=sample(letters, 15), value1=rnorm(15))
df2 <- data.frame(ID=sample(letters, 15), value2=rnorm(15))
common <- intersect(df1$ID, df2$ID)

df1[ match(common, df1$ID), ]
df2[ match(common, df2$ID), ]

cbind(df1[ match(common, df1$ID), ], df2[ match(common, df2$ID), ])
```

## Merging

A better, but more complex solution to merge two data frames is the
`merge()` function.

Some SQL terminology:

 * inner join: we are merging only common elements
 * outer join: we are making sure that elements from both sets are taken
   over
 * left outer join: same, but only for the first set
 * right outer join: same, but only for the second set


## Merging (cont.)

Usage of the `merge()` function:

```{r}
merge(df1, df2) # inner join by default
merge(df1, df2, all.x=TRUE) # left outer join
merge(df1, df2, all.y=TRUE) # right outer join
merge(df1, df2, all=TRUE) # outer join
```

Note: tidyverse contains functions `inner_join`, `outer_join` etc. which
look slightly more specific (but do the same).

## Merging (cont.)

The `by`, `by.x` and `by.y` parameters tell `merge` which columns contain
the identifiers by which to join. It is always safer to specify this
parameter!

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(ID=c("a", "a", "b", "c"), no=c(1, 2, 3, 4), 
  value=rnorm(4))
df2 <- data.frame(ID=c("a", "a", "b", "c"), no=c(1, 2, 3, 4), 
  value=rnorm(4))
merge(df1, df2)           ## not what we wanted
merge(df1, df2, by="ID")  ## not what we wanted
merge(df1, df2, by=c("ID", "no"))
```

## Merging (cont.)

A simpler (but requiring more steps) alternative would be to make a new
identifier:

```{r}
df1$ID2 <- paste(df1$ID, df1$no, sep=".")
df2$ID2 <- paste(df2$ID, df2$no, sep=".")
merge(df1, df2, by="ID2")
```

## Another example

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(subject.id=1:3, sex=c("M", "F", "F"), 
  age=c(28, 35, 29))
df2 <- data.frame(subject.id=rep(1:3, each=2), 
  timepoint=rep(1:2, 3), value=rnorm(6))
merge(df1, df2, by="subject.id")
```


## Excercise 4.3

The files `expression_data_vaccination_example.xlsx` and
`labresults_full.csv` contain data from the same study.

 1. read the first sheet from the XLSX file and the CSV file.
 3. Which columns ID the subjects? Are there any subjects in common? How do
    you match the subjects?
 5. We are interested only in the following information: Subject ID, ARM
    (group), Time point, sex, age, test name and the actual measurement.
    Are the measurements numeric? Remember, you can use expressions like `[ , c("ARM", "sex") ]` 
    to select the desired columns from a data set.
 4. Use the subjects to merge the two data frames however you see fit. Note
    that there are multiple time points per subject and multiple
    measurements per subject and time point.

# Getting help

Use `?` and `??` to get contextual help in R. Note that if you want to look
for a help page for anything other than a "regular" name, e.g. an operator,
  you ned to put it in quotes:

```
??"%in%"
```

# Variable types

## Investigating variable types 

`class` returns the class of a variable. `str` shows a shortened summary of
what the variable structure is.

## Numeric vs character variables

```
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
a <- 1:3
```

`seq` can be used to create arbitrary sequences with specified length or
specified step.

```
a <- seq(1, 3, length.out=100)
a <- seq(1, 3, by=.1)
```

If the vector contains strings, the result will automatically be a
character vector:

```
a <- c("a", "b", 6)
a <- c(1, 2, "3")
```

You can explicitely convert strings to numeric vectors:

```
a <- c("1", "2", "30", " 2")
as.numeric(a)
```

Numbers which cannot be converted to numerals will be replaced by "Not
available" â€“ `NA`.

## Vectors

Vectors are created with the function `c()`:

```
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
```

Another function useful to create numeric vectors:

```
rep(c(1, 2), 4)
rep(c(1, 3), each=3)
```

Note that all values in a vector must be of the same type (e.g. numeric,
character or logical).

To access elements of a vector, we use the bracket `[` operator:

```
a <- 1:10
a[1]
a[2:5]
a[c(1, 2, 5)] # first, second and fifth element
```

In R, most operators will work on the whole vector. 

```
a <- 1:10
a * 2    # returns c(2, 4, ...)
a + 10   # returns c(11, 12, ...)
```

Some important functions for vectors. Find out what they do:

```
sum(a)
mean(a)
var(a)
sd(a)
length(a)
```


## Logical operators and vectors

Logical vectors and variables can take only one of two values: `TRUE` or
`FALSE`. There is a shorthand for these (`T` and `F`, respectively), but
don't use it, because these shorthands can be redefined.

We can use logical vectors as *subscripts* to select element from a
vector:

```
pvals <- c(.5, 1, .01, .1, .005)
genes <- c("BATF2", "ANKRD22", "IFNG", "TERT", "NFKB")

genes[ pvals < .05 ]
```

There are two types of logical operators. 

`&` and `|` return a vector. These forms are used most frequently, as they
are extremely useful in combining logical vectors:

```
pvals <- c(.05, .04, 1, 0.7, .1, .01, .02)
lfcs <- c(1.5, -1.2, 2, 1.5, -0.7, -1.4, 0.9)

pvals.sign <- pvals < .05
lfcs.large <- abs(lfcs) > 1 # what does abs() do?

## how many significant pvals and lfcs do we have?
sum(pvals.sign)
sum(lfcs.large)

## both large lfc and significant pvals
pvals.sign & lfcs.large

## same as above without additional variables:
pvals < .05 & abs(lfcs) > 1
```

`&&` and `||` return a single value and are mostly used in combination with
`if(...)`.

```
if(a > 5) {
  print("a is larger than 5")
} else {
  print("a is not larger than 5")
}
```

Finally, the operator `!` ("bang", or *negation*) is the same whether you
use vectors or single values:

```
a <- pvals < .05
!a
```

## Factors

Factors are used for categorical variables. They are necessary in many
statistical analyses.

```
group <- c("Patient", "Control", "Control ", "Patient", "Control")
class(group)
group <- factor(group)
class(group)
summary(group)
levels(group)
```

## Lists

Lists are an enormously versatile and important data type. List are
containers that allow to put together variables of different type:

```
person1 <- list(name="January", lastname="Weiner", fingers=c(5, 5, 5, 5))
person2 <- list(name="Three Finger Joe", lastname="NN", fingers=c(3, 5, 5, 5))
person3 <- list(name="Zarggz'h", lastname="X1232", fingers=c(7, 7, 7, 7))
```

To access elements of a named list, we can use either a double bracket or a
dollar `$` operator:

```
person1$fingers
person2[[1]]
```

Lists can also be elements of a list:

```
mypeople <- list(person1, person2, person3)
```

This last list is *unnamed* and to access its element we need to use the
`[` bracket operator again. Single bracket returns a shortened list, while
a double bracket returns the actual element of the list.

```
mypeople[1]
mypeople[2:3]
mypeople[[1]]
```


# Functions

Simple function definition looks as follows:

```
#' Short description what the function does
someMeaningfulName <- function(par1, par2=pi, par3=10) {
  result <- sin(par1 + par2 + par3)
  return(result)
}
```

Functions should ideally communicate with the environment only using parameters to
the function and the return value.

# R crash course 02/2022

The CUBI R crash course

**Notes on lectures.** Lectures are always available as two files. The
Rmarkdown file (extension .Rmd) is the source file. It is easy to browse
and to understand, just click on it to view it. You can learn a bit of
Rmarkdown with that, and also you will see exactly how all the plots and R
output are generated.

HTML files (the ready presentations) are a bit more tricky. Github does not
allow viewing these files directly, if you click on them, you will see the
HTML source.

To view HTML files, use the following links:

**Advanced:** Cloning the repository using Rstudio.

All course materials are on the website [https://github.com/bihealth/RcrashCourse2021/](https://github.com/bihealth/RcrashCourse2021/). 
This webpage is a *repository*. Instead of downloading the materials one by
one, you can make a perfect copy locally (which is called "cloning") and
update it (semi-)automatically when anything changes.

If you want to save yourself some work (and learn something new at the same
time), you can directly clone the repository of the course using Rstudio. 

First, install git (follow the instructions
[here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077?version=2022.07.1%2B554&mode=desktop)).

Once git is installed, open Rstudio, select File -> New Project, then choose "Version
control", "Git", and enter "https://github.com/bihealth/RcrashCourse2021/"
as the repository URL. Select a directory where you would like to clone the
repository, and click the "Create repository" button. Rstudio will download
all course materials.

In the top right corner, a new pane appears with the name "git". When you
select it, clicking the blue "down" arrow ("pull") will update your local
directory with any changes that have been made to the course repo in the
meanwhile.

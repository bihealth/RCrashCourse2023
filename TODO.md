* Day 2: 
  add a slide on absolute vs relative directory paths

  spend more time on logical vectors, e.g. is.na(), which(), sum(vec)

  add selecting vectors / rows by logical vectors

  maybe skip the matrices and do lists + data frames / tibbles first (

* Day 3: 

 * limit the regular expressions to a minimum
 * make this part shorter

 
* Day 4 

 * start with exercises earlier
 * use only tidyverse for ordering and filtering? (filter & arrange) -> base R is still part of the slide deck, but will not be covered in the lecture
 

 * Merging (cont.) -> figure out a better example

 * give better examples and easier exercise
 
Other

 * Record a video about saving graphics to files

 * check whether all data is necessary (repo too big)

 * tell them to download the datasets before everything else (because the
   download takes time)
